                        The WAR was ON!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The KEYS on the typewriter had SHARP POINTS that kept sticking into our fingers!
                        The dictating equipment started asking US questions!
                        And our beepers sent electric SHOCKS just through our body, like a cattle prod...
                        Out in the warehouse, the trucks kept BANGIN' into the docks -- not even thinking about stoppin'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oh, our frail BODIES were strapped to the chairs, and our chairs were CHAINED to the desks.
                        Our pleas for justice were IGNORED, and the end seemed near...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But we BUSTED our slave drivers little bitty balls!
                        We charged OUT of their brick fortress! The streets. are. OURS. because... IT'S FRIDAY!!!!!
                    </p>
